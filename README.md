# The Lord of The Rings wikipedia (ID Assignment 2)

github page link: https://calebchoo1.github.io/IDAssignment2/

My project allows fans of the novel "The Lord of the Rings" to search for its books, characters and movies. They can see all the books and movies with just a click of a button. There is a separate section for the information of books and movies. There is also a section which allows users to search for characters. The specific character's information will be displayed. (race, gender, etc...). The last section contains a random quote generator which displays a random quote along with which character and movie it is from. I feel that this would help fans of the novel to know more about the characters and also discover movies they might not have watched yet. This website can also be used by people who are new to the novel but would like to find out more about it. Hence i feel that my website is useful in helping its users to search and retrieve information on The Lord of the Rings.
 
## Design Process

I wanted this website to provide useful and good functions to the fans of The Lord of the Rings and also anyone trying to find more information about the series. I decided to go with one big section for the about section since it would attract their attention to read the short description which might be informative for the users who are new to the series. There are 4 smaller sections which include the books, movies, characters and quotes. These sections have a specific function which displays information by clicking each of the buttons. I made these sections small as they were the main functions of the website and i feel that they should be grouped together so that they can be used simultaneously. For example, when a user generates a quote and sees the character and movie it is from, he can just search the name of the character and movie in the various search functions. For the background images, i went with different high resolution The Lord of the Ring images.

- As a person new to the series, I want to know what the Lord of the Rings is about, hence I click the about section on the navigation bar to read the information displayed.
- As a person new to the series, I want to know more about the books of this series, hence I click the books section on the navigation bar to look at all the image, title and  description of all the books.
- As a person new to the series, I want to know all the movies of the series, hence I click on the movie section of the navigation bar and click the display all movies button. 
- As a person new to the series, I want to generate a random quote, hence i click on the quotes section on the navigation bar and click the generate random quote button.
- As a fan of the series, I want to know more about the details of a movie. Hence I click the movie section on the navigation bar and search the name of the movie.
- As a fan of the series, I want to more more details about a character, hence I click the characters section on the navigation bar and search the name of the charcter.
- As a fan of the series, I want to generate a random quote, hence i click on the quotes section on the navigation bar and click the generate random quote button.

- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
